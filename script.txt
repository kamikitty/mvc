If there is one design pattern you should learn today, MVC is it. 
This pattern is tried and true - it has been used and tested across many different languages and by generations of programmers.
It is one of the most common patterns you will see and not knowing it can set you back.

Avoid programming nightmares by using MVC to organize your code.
